## RCC DESIGN BY INTERACTION SURFACE AND MOMENTCURVATURE DIAGRAM. GRAPHIC INTERFACE IN MATLAB

### [Patricio Palacios](https://github.com/ppalacios92) 

This investigation is based on different models to obtain a moment-curvature diagram of various Reinforced Concrete Columns (RCC). The research aims to identify a model that allows obtaining adequate results regarding the structural performance of these RCC sections. Ductility variation is analyzed, which can be presented by adding nonlinear materials, considering biaxial behavior, and accounting for axial load effects. To achieve this ductility variation, two different conditions were developed, which consider deformation limits and damage controls for the materials.

The first condition addresses non-structural safety affectation, while the second condition pertains to the severe damage state of structural elements. These performance conditions were evaluated for several discretization approaches of the cross-section and the utilization of some constitutive materials existing in the bibliography, including the ACI 318S proposal and the Mander et al. (1988) concrete confined model. These idealizations were compared with each other to determine RCC design using a graphic interface, considering different ductility magnitudes and their variations when axial load and biaxial bending behavior are taken into account.
